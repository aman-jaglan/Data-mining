# Question 1: Create a Markdown cell with the following:
# Two paragraphs about yourself. In one of the paragraphs, give a hyperlink of a website 
# that you want us to see. Can be about yourself, or something you like.

#About Myself
#
#I'm Aman, and while my name means "peace," I'm more of an enthusiast than a calm person. 
#I studied Information Technology at Maharaja Agrasen Institute of Technology. During my studies 
#I wrote two research papersâ€”one on Intrusion Detection Systems and another on searching for relevant text using Python and machine learning.
#
#I started my career at Protiviti as a Software Engineer, where I worked on tasks like cleaning and processing data. 
#Now, I'm working towards becoming a data scientist, excited about the opportunities in this field. 
#I look forward to the journey ahead and appreciate your consideration of my background and goals.
#
#I love sports, whenever I get bore or have free time I always prefer this website https://www.espn.com. It's really have all the details regarding every sports.
# They run the matches all day long and keeps you updated for the upcoming games.


#%%
# Question 2: Create
# a list of all the class titles that you are planning to take in the data science program. 
# Have at least 6 classes, even if you are not a DS major
# Then print out the last entry in your list.

classes = ['Intro to data science','Intro to data mining', 'Intro to data warehousing', 'Machine learning 1', 'Machine learning 2', 'Deep learning']
print(classes[5])

# Question 3: After you completed question 2, you feel Intro to data mining is too stupid, so you are going 
# to replace it with Intro to Coal mining. Do that in Python here.

classes[1] = 'Intro to coal mining'
print(classes)


#%%
# Question 4: Before you go see your academic advisor, you are 
# asked to create a Python dictionary of the classes you plan to take, 
# with the course number as key. Please do that. Don't forget that your advisor 
# probably doesn't like coal. And that coal mining class doesn't even have a 
# course number.

subjectDict = {
    6101 : "Intro to data science",
    6102 : "Data warehousing",
    6103 : "Intro to data mining"  
}

print(subjectDict[6101])

#%%
# Question 5: print out and show your advisor how many 
# classes (print out the number, not the list/dictionary) you plan 
# to take.

# Question 6: Using loops 
# Goal: print out the list of days (31) in Jan 2023 like this
# Sun - 2023/1/1
# Mon - 2023/1/2
# Tue - 2023/1/3
# Wed - 2023/1/4
# Thu - 2023/1/5
# Fri - 2023/1/6
# Sat - 2023/1/7
# Sun - 2023/1/8
# Mon - 2023/1/9
# ...
# You might find something like this useful, especially if you use the remainder property x % 7
